# UTD-CS4341-Project
CS 4341 - Digital Logic and Computer Design 

- Objective:

Create a multi-state, digitally encoded processing unit of some form. Each system should have a 
minimum of four system states: Select, Calibrate, Start,  and  Stop. Each of these states should have at least four 
instructions. Combinational and Sequential Logic should both be covered  in the project.

- Topic:

Create an ALU with full datapath
Add, multiply, divide, subtract two numbers, and remember the result to add the next number.  An ALU 
can be turned on, can be turned off, can be reset, can be actively processing.  Numbers should be a 
minimum of 8 bit integer.  This is the classic example that is in the textbook.  What is desired is a Verilog 
system that can operate as a calculator with a set of logic gates attached.
  Add two numbers
  Subtract two numbers
  Multiply two numbers
  Do an AND on two numbers
  Do an OR on two numbers
  Do a NOT on one number
  Do an XOR on two numbers
  The current value in the ALU must remain until cleared. A clear command must be included.
